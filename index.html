                 Neutron stars can spin at a rate of 600 rotations per second. Neutron stars are one of the possible evolutionary end-points of high mass stars. They're born in a core-collapse supernova star explosion and subsequently rotate extremely rapidly as a consequence of their physics. Neutron stars can rotate up to 60 times per second after born. Under special circumstances, this rate can increase to more than 600 times per second.</p>

                <h2 class="text-[36px]">Cold Welding</h2>
                 If two pieces of the same type of metal touch in space, they will bond and be permanently stuck together. This amazing effect is called cold welding. It happens because the atoms of the individual pieces of metal have no way of knowing that they are different pieces of metal, so the lumps join together. This wouldn't happen on Earth because there is air and water separating the pieces. The effect has a lot of implications for spacecraft construction and the future of metal-based construction in vacuums.</p>

                The Apollo astronauts' footprints on the moon will probably stay there for at least 100 million years. Since the moon doesn't have an atmosphere, there's no wind or water to erode or wash away the Apollo astronauts' mark on the moon. That means their footprints, roverprints, spaceship prints, and discarded materials will stay preserved on the moon for a very long time. They won't stay on there forever, though. The moon still a dynamic environment. It's actually being constantly bombarded with "micrometeorites," which means that erosion is still happening on the moon, just very slowly.</p>

                 The largest asteroid in our solar system is a mammoth piece of space rock named Ceres. The asteroid — which is sometimes known as a dwarf planet — is almost 600 miles in diameter. It's by far the largest in the Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter and accounts for a whole third of the belt's mass. Ceres' surface area is approximately equal to the land area of India or Argentina. The uncrewed spacecraft Dawn finished up its mission orbiting Ceres in Oct. 2018, helping us totally transform our understanding of the world.</p>

                 More energy from the sun hits Earth every hour than the planet uses in a year. The use of solar energy has increased at a rate of 20 percent each year for the past 15 years. According to Yale Environment 360, the world added 30 percent more solar energy capacity in 2017, meaning that 98.9 gigawatts of solar energy was produced that year. Despite seemingly large number, this amount of energy only accounts for 0.7 percent of the world's annual electricity usage.</p>

                <h2 class="text-[36px]">The Mighty Sun</h2>
                <p class="text-[16px]">99 percent of our solar system's mass is the sun. Our star, the sun, is so dense that it accounts for a whopping 99 percent of the mass of our entire solar system. That's what allows it to dominate all of the planets gravitationally. Technically, our sun is a "G-type main-sequence star" which means that every second, it fuses approximately 600 million tons of hydrogen to helium. It also converts about 4 million tons of matter to energy as a byproduct. When the sun dies, it will become a red giant and envelop the Earth and everything on it. But don't worry: That won't happen for another 5 billion years.</p>
